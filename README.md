Welcome to my portfolio! üíª üéâ <br /><br />
Here, you will find some of my work in python, including some logic-focused programs, and especially a video game (150+ lines) I created using functions, various loops, and conditional logic. 
Enjoy!

Python Game:<br />
-Built a text-based adventure game in Python, inspired by The Legend of Zelda series, immersing the player in a dungeon-crawling escape scenario. ‚öîÔ∏è<br />
-Included input validation to handle user misentries gracefully without breaking the game experience. <br />
-Managed player health and conditional game flow to allow for dynamic difficulty, where poor decisions lead to progressive health loss and game over scenarios. <br />
-Programming accounts for the different end-user decisions, including non-hard coded death and quit ("while quit and health > 0"). <br /><br />

Python Pizza Ordering System:<br />
-Developed an interactive console-based pizza ordering system using Python, simulating a real-world point-of-sale experience for a fictional pizza parlour, Pizza Perfection.<br />
-Created a real-time receipt summary that updates based on the user‚Äôs selections, with visual formatting and itemized costing (e.g. toppings 4+ billed at $0.50). <br />
-Designed the code for expandability and future enhancements, such as file saving, multiple pizza orders, or a GUI/web version.<br /><br />
