Welcome to my portfolio! 💻 🎉 
Here, you will find some of my work in python, inluding some basic logic-focused programs, and especially a video game (150+ lines) I created using functional and conditional logic. 
Enjoy!

Python Game:
-Using functions like clear() and importing python libraries like time and os, created a smooth-running game with references to the Legend of Zelda game series to immerse the gamer. ⚔️
-Used while loops (while true + while var). ➰
-Programming accounts for the different end-user decisions, including non-hard coded death and quit ("while quit and health > 0"). 🖱️
